      <description>The registration for the MRI4ALL Hackathon is closed now, and the selected participants have been notified. Preparations for the hackathon are in full swing, and ordered components for the scanner are arriving almost every day. We can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the event to take place next month!
If you have been selected for the hackathon, please make sure to join the invitation to the MRI4ALL Slack channel, as this will be our primary communication platform before and during the event.</description>
